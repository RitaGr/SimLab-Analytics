# Boutique Retail Analytics in a Simulated Bookshop
Customer behavior analysis using a controlled simulation environment

## Description
This project explores customer behavior and inventory decisions in a small
boutique retail environment using a simulated bookshop.

The goal is to practice end-to-end data analysis workflows — from data
collection and cleaning to exploratory analysis, experimentation, and
business recommendations — in a controlled setting where variables can be
intentionally modified and observed.

## Disclosure
All data in this project is generated through structured observation of a
simulated retail environment. No real customers or real businesses are
involved.

## Scope
This project focuses on:
- Customer arrival and browsing behavior
- Purchase decisions
- Inventory availability and curation

It does not attempt to model real-world book market demand or make claims
about real consumer behavior.
